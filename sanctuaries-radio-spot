This is a transcript of the ‘Local Stories’ segment from the Friday, March 19, 2021 edition of <i>Morning Edition</i> from member station KILL 103.7 in the tri-state area surrounding Killdeer, Ohio and West Virginia.

In this particular segment of ‘Local Stories,’ Schneider interviews local artist Nana Qaradaghi, whose new non-profit Sanctuaries -- a housing and public arts venture launched in part with ABRAXAS Technologies’ founder Everett Walker -- will be opening its inaugural open house for affordable housing in the Killdeer region on Wednesday. The clip starts at 45 minutes into the hour.

And now, as is Friday custom, here is ‘Local Stories’ -- an in-depth look into what makes the Killdeer area one of the most vibrant gems on the Ohio River Valley. Today, we’re talking with studio artist and philanthropist Nana Qaradaghi, whose brand-new project Sanctuaries will be opening next Wednesday, March 24. Ms. Qaradaghi, welcome to the program.

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:46:17.35
Thank you very much, Zahara. It is a pleasure to be here this morning.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:46:47.17
Could you tell us about Sanctuaries and the inspiration behind developing this particular agency, especially here in Killdeer and around Belmont and Marshall Counties?

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:47:19.09
Of course. Sanctuaries was born from a need that I am sure most millennials can identify with: offering affordable housing to the public.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:47:59.11
Interesting. Why in Killdeer? Given the housing market here, there is certainly an argument that there is no issue with purchasing property here in the slightest.

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:48:30.41
A fair assessment -- especially given where I was last living, the property cost is on average considerably lower. <i>[laughs]</i> What I am not sure is being taken into account with the low cost of entry is the labor needed for that house to become a home. To assume that any young professional coming into the market has the energy, budget, or wherewithal to enter an extensive renovation project when buying a home in the Killdeer area -- or anywhere across the United States, for that matter -- is something that I would deem exclusionary. Anyone who wants a home should not have to weigh the options between if they have the budget to invest into their property or if they simply wish to have a home to reside.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:49:45.22
What inspired you to start Sanctuaries in the first place? 

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:49:55.19
My background is not an uncommon immigrant story, I think, but it is usually unheard -- unheard enough that it ends up being a subject of my work outside of the non-profit sector. I am a Kurd, born on the Iraq-Iran border during a war between the countries. This war, as it went, displaced my family significantly. So I have known a loss of home, of living in refugee camps, of waiting to be accepted into the States and to live in our sponsor’s home while we settled. So housing insecurity, it is a thing I knew well as a child. I have also known the opposite of that, in a great privilege of having an incredibly comfortable home with a loved one, with family. The contrast of that disparity, of remembering both things -- it makes this important to me. Ergo, the name Sanctuaries: making safe spaces for this new place I call home is important. Especially after Covid, especially after that, that perilousness of our neighbors in hoping they would not be evicted, hm?

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:51:07.05
Knowing that you’re wanting to tackle such a large issue, what is Sanctuaries doing first?

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:51:48.09
One of the most incredible things about Killdeer are their pockets of Sears Kit Homes. This isn’t the segment to discuss this <i>[shared laughter]</i>, but the history behind Sears homes is incredibly fascinating. They’re also a prime candidate for standardized renovations that both respect the history of the home while allowing for efficient updates. Sanctuaries has five test homes prepared for the market, which we’ll be debuting at our Open House on Wednesday.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:52:21.18
How will the Open House operate? Is this a case of a self-guided tour to all five houses?

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:52:51.45
Ah, a wonderful question! We wanted to make the Open House as accessible to the public as possible. As such, we’ll be holding the event in Ballroom A at Killdeer Community College with a variety of booths to show the sample interiors for the houses on offer.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:53:20.01
What does an interested party need to know about the Open House, in case they need to come by?

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:53:35.17
We’ll be open to the general public on the campus of Killdeer Community College at 6pm on Wednesday, March 24, with donor access at 5pm for dinner and cocktails. There will be raffles for interested parties, as well as self-guided tours of all of the sample interiors throughout the ballroom. We’ll be open until 8pm.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:53:59.41
Just in case someone might miss it but is still interested, are there any other ways to view the initial five homes?

<b style="color: #081EA8;">Nana Qaradaghi</b>
00:54:11.01
Yes, Zahara! We’ll have opportunities for you to reach out to us by appointment -- simply search for “Sanctuaries Killdeer” or go to www.sanctuaries-oh.org.

<b style="color: #EB053F;">Zahara Schneider</b>
00:54:32.17
