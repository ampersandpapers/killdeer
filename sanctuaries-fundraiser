<b>Killdeer Community College</b><br>
<i>Wednesday, March 24 &mdash; 6:00 - 8:00p.m.</i><br>
</span>

<span style="display: block; padding: 10px;">
Starting with<b> early donor entry at 5pm</b>, the Killdeer Community College has opened its doors for the <b>Sanctuaries Open House</b>, acting as the nascent non-profit’s first official event and introduction into the Killdeer community. <a href="https://asylums.insanejournal.com/arbys/10218.html" title="Nana's interview with KILL 103.7.">As announced on local NPR affiliate KILL 103.7</a>, the Open House is to launch Sanctuaries’ Equitable Housing Initiative. At present, Sanctuaries has purchased and renovated five <a href="http://www.searsarchives.com/homes/index.htm" title="About Sears Kit Homes from the Sears Archives.">Sears Kit Homes</a> with the intention of selling them below market value to lower and mid-income individuals and families in Killdeer that have found home ownership to be beyond their grasp. <br><br>

As the homes in question are currently undergoing final inspection, the Open House is set up at the Community College and has a variety of sample interiors spread across the ballroom for interested parties (or nosy onlookers) to peruse. As Sanctuaries is A Classy Event for Area Families and Professionals™, there is a children’s area featuring <b>Hank Zappa</b> and his magical stylings for some delightful diversions, as well as childcare for toddlers and infants that are beyond the mystical allure of the Amazing Zappa’s craft. Sadly, no alcohol for those adults &ndash; that’s what you get for hosting this on a college campus instead of the casino, guys &ndash; but there <i>are</i> some lovely finger foods floating about for one and all.<br><br>

But of course: as Killdeer is Killdeer, this perfectly gentle and reasonable event couldn’t just go off without a hitch, now could it?
