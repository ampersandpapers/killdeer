<b>Killdeer Community College</b><br>
<i>Wednesday, March 24 &mdash; 6:00 - 8:00p.m.</i><br>
</span>

<span style="display: block; padding: 10px;">
Starting with<b> early donor entry at 5pm</b>, the Killdeer Community College has opened its doors for the <b>Sanctuaries Open House</b>, acting as the nascent non-profit‚Äôs first official event and introduction into the Killdeer community. <a href="https://asylums.insanejournal.com/arbys/10218.html" title="Nana's interview with KILL 103.7.">As announced on local NPR affiliate KILL 103.7</a>, the Open House is to launch Sanctuaries‚Äô Equitable Housing Initiative. At present, Sanctuaries has purchased and renovated five <a href="http://www.searsarchives.com/homes/index.htm" title="About Sears Kit Homes from the Sears Archives.">Sears Kit Homes</a> with the intention of selling them below market value to lower and mid-income individuals and families in Killdeer that have found home ownership to be beyond their grasp. <br><br>

As the homes in question are currently undergoing final inspection, the Open House is set up at the Community College and has a variety of sample interiors spread across the ballroom for interested parties (or nosy onlookers) to peruse. As Sanctuaries is A Classy Event for Area Families and Professionals‚Ñ¢, there is a children‚Äôs area featuring <b>Hank Zappa</b> and his magical stylings for some delightful diversions, as well as childcare for toddlers and infants that are beyond the mystical allure of the Amazing Zappa‚Äôs craft. Sadly, no alcohol for those adults &ndash; that‚Äôs what you get for hosting this on a college campus instead of the casino, guys &ndash; but there <i>are</i> some lovely finger foods floating about for one and all.<br><br>

But of course: as Killdeer is Killdeer, this perfectly gentle and reasonable event couldn‚Äôt just go off without a hitch, now could it?

<b style="display: block; border: 1px solid rgba(189,189,189,.6); background: rgba(189,189,189,.1); padding: 5px; text-align: center; font-size: 15px; text-transform: uppercase;">Volunteer Spots</b>

<span style="display: block; padding: 10px;">
<b>THE HAMILTON</b> &ndash; a rather punctual person, by principle &ndash; manages to arrive even <i>before</i> donor doors open and manages to see <b>NANA QARADAGHI</b> running around the event center with a certain amount of frantic energy. As they peek to see if they‚Äôre able to get in, <b>THE HAMILTON</b> notices that not one but <i>two</i> monstera planters appear within the sample living room that‚Äôs at the center of the ballroom. Uhhhh???<br><br>

Meanwhile, <b>HANK <s>ZIMMERMAN</s> ZAPPA</b> is preparing for his set, which is to start after the donors sneak peek at 5. <b>THE CHELSEA</b> walks by with their canape and hears <b>HANK</b> bemoaning the state of his roses, only to notice that they not only seem perfectly fine, but are practically-no-<i>literally</i> multiplying as they fall off the chair they‚Äôd been set upon and onto the floor. When <b>THE CHELSEA</b> taps him on the shoulder and hands him the flowers, both are understandably stymied.
<br><br>
Once it hits 6pm, it‚Äôs off to the races! <b>THE NIOTA</b> and <b>THE MAYTOWN</b> missed the memo that a Muslim woman was putting ths party on and are complaining that their <i>favorite</i> Killdeer Community College Catering appetizer, the elusive pigs in a blanket, is not on the menu. Within minutes, <b>THE NIOTA</b> manages to get a plate, but as Ms. Qaradaghi passes by and flares her eyes in alarm, <b>THE MAYTOWN‚Äôs</b> matching plate suddenly turns into‚Ä¶ beef jerky in a blanket? Oh <i>my</i>.<br><br>

<b>THE ARLINGTON</b> came here with <b>THE HILLROSE</b>, who seems genuinely excited about this project now that they‚Äôre walking through. <b>THE ARLINGTON</b>, however, insists they‚Äôd be more convinced if Sanctuaries had put up a sample backyard &ndash; don‚Äôt poor people deserve decks, too??? As <b>THE ARLINGTON</b> grumbles about this, there‚Äôs a bit of background noise, nothing too noticeable‚Ä¶ until they find themselves walking into a patch of perfectly manicured grass.<br><br>

By this time, the kids are here and they are <i>loving</i> what <b>HANK ZAPPA</b> is putting down. And admittedly? So is <b>THE WABASH</b>, who‚Äôs decided to sit down and watch the performance. As <b>HANK</b> gestures out into the audience, <b>THE WABASH</b> is surprised (and delighted!) to see a bunch of doves erupt from behind them. <b>HANK</b>, however, stammers in the middle of his set &ndash; but honestly, only the adults really notice.<br><br>

Of course, the fact that there‚Äôs <i>a yard suddenly appearing in the middle of the ballroom</i> has started a bit of a commotion, but not enough for <b>THE HAZLETON</b> or <b>THE NATOMA</b> to notice. No, they‚Äôre checking out the living room (you know, the one with the sick monstera?) and are wanting to find, uh, somewhere‚Ä¶ <i>private</i>, if you know what I mean. Despite the fact that the bedroom sample space is on the opposite side of the ballroom, they open the adjacent door and find themselves right there! ‚Ä¶ unfortunately, <b>THE OSBORN</b> and <b>THE PRESTON</b> had the same idea and are currently very confused to see <b>THE HAZELTON</b> and <b>THE NATOMA</b> interrupting their makeout sesh on the sample bed.<br><br>

Before they can process what‚Äôs happening, an official with the College is running through the ballroom &ndash; everybody out now! Apparently, whoever wanted to see the backyard <i>also</i> wanted to see a fire pit, so now it‚Äôs a goddamn hazard, UGH. At least it‚Äôs right at 8, so Sanctuaries isn‚Äôt <i>too</i> put out.<br><br>

Well, if you‚Äôre friends with Nana, you might notice that she‚Äôs looking significantly faint and shaky, so maybe that‚Äôs not the best thing to say, but who cares? It‚Äôs Killdeer, let‚Äôs go to The Elms for a post-fundraiser afterparty rager, woohoo!
