there are r o &nbsp;o &nbsp;&nbsp;t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s in your marrow,

One blink, two, three:

<blockquote>chronologically speaking, you are mostly stardust, as most any living creature is but you moreso, if the definition of stardust in your case is merely the framing of the negative space around each nebulae, the absence of light and warmth and sound, a vibration that desperately runs through the vacuum in an attempt to touch someone’s ears

but, of course, even vacuums eventually run against an atmosphere,
a ray of light is absorbed by a lens,
magma brews itself an atmosphere,
a star explodes to form the iron of your blood,
a shadow finds its penumbra.</blockquote>

When the man wakes up in the corn field, there’s a fountain of ichor and blood running down his front. The liquid, thick and steady, rolls up his neck as he pushes up from his ass-turned-teakettle tangle in the ditch, his bony ankles resting aside the road with no shoes to cover the funny sprawl of stretched skin over tendon and metatarsal. 

There’s a metal twang to what greets his tongue when he runs his teeth over it, bright and incongruent to anything he remembers to be palatable,

<blockquote><i>(what he remembers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</i></blockquote>
and as he pushes to standing, bones creak against the funny, scratching trousers that cover his knobby knees. A thought he’s never thought before comes as reflexively as a blink, <i>make the useful form</i>, and each fiber of skeletal shard reports to attention. His hands, for the time, stay their size. The skin across the bridge of his nose, taut and slick with internal inkblack and the salt of perspiration, momentarily eases its siege.

Blearily, he commences his walk to the east. 

It is a cold night, and soon the wet pool that dribbles from his orifices has become a frozen patch of fabric against the plane of his chest. There is an unspoken instinct to conserve where he can and so the frozen blood is beating against nothing but bony ribs and a sack of black flesh beneath, all his brittle command of self focused on looking as he should for eyes he knows are not prepared. The man does not know who These Unprepared Creatures are so much as they simply exist in little huddled communities, shielded from the elements. He combs his mind,

<blockquote><i>(what he remembers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</i></blockquote>
and brushes against fissures and chasms, blocks of memory gone that makes no sense. He knows there are fae and everyone else, he knows that magic is stitching him together, he knows that something has happened to what he was, he knows that he is about to discover what he will be.

He glances down at his hand and shakes it into a broad palm, flat, no claws. 

Wait.




He’s starting to wake up, as his feet instinctively attempt to resist the glass in the road and he must shove them into tender pink flesh, the bloody footprints in the snow apparently the preferred alternative. Wind is crisp and wet, the sort of thing that raises bones out of the grave; the sky has her duvet this evening, fluffy black clouds tucking the moon to sleep. A few times, he has to duck back into the culvert as the whizz of bright lanterns go past, great stinking machinations of metal dragging behind them. He probes again,

<blockquote><i>(what he remembers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)</i></blockquote>
and finds another great streak of soot where any comprehension of what those strange smoke-chuggers might be. So he simply climbs out and walks again, walks through pebbles and across flat black sheets of stone, across funny low bridges and high metal ones, against the glow of funny towers shaped like two parenthesis turned in on each other, great columns of stewing steam reaching to touch their sister clouds in the distance.

The man, by now, has shoved his hands (now claws, now deeper than shadows) into the pocket of those funny trousers, hunching his shoulders just enough to ward off any approach. But it’s the witching hour in the little hamlet he’s stumbled across, a rather unceremonious sign announcing its name to be <i>KILLDEER</i> in funny, shiny letters that blind him when one of the smoke-chuggers speeds past. Their lamps glow a fuzzy rose-gold, as if the sunset twilight was canned into a lamp and burned with the absence of its soul. It works in his favor, as he crawls up the hills that force his ankles to snap in funny ways. 

At one point, he looks into a window. A sliver of paper looks back at him. It says <i>OCTOBER 1983</i>. The man does not know what this means.

He does not know what many things mean, as the claws inside his pockets strain against the plastic fabric. He does know what wood boarded up against the windows mean, knows what a window without even the faintest glow of a courtesy lamp means. He climbs the highest hill even as his funny knees strain against the scratchy pantlegs, as they pop backwards upon being greeted with a stairwell as insult to injury.

The man does not need keys when he has a will, and the door swings out as he lurches in with an urgency that strained him upon setting inside city limits.

The skin across his snout snaps with a wet pop, a tendon’s elastic saying goodbye to its tether as an excruciating crunch unravels from his skull. He stumbles, grasping against the peeling wallpaper before yanking it into a shred, a great protrusion of spine against shoulder gouging the parlor room wood. It’s where he stays as skin shrinks away, as a collar of fur blossoms out of the night, as the breadth of his shoulders and vertebrae add themselves to the length of his spine.

For a while, the shadows hold him. They are patient servants who know their master, know that he exists in an agony as broad as his chasm of memory is wide. He seeks conference with his mind, 

<blockquote><i>(what he remembers: rootsinhismarrow, teethinhisblood, earthinthesocketsofhis e y e s )</i></blockquote>
and finds that a tonic would perhaps behoove him. Witlessly, he shuts his eyes and allows his consciousness to bleed into penumbra, which sneaks about in the crevices as they should. Glass bottles were a dime a dozen in this rambling home, he sees, as he pushes through cabinets and drawers and closets alike.

But something rings familiar as a tendril, sharp and spiky, drags one particular bottle back towards his body in repose.

Two embers blink to life as the tendril holds the bottle aloft in front of his face.

“Old Number Seven,” the monster drawls, mandibles clicking against their joints. “Perhaps this will ease me.”

<hr>
In the light of day, bottle empty and ribs kicked sharp by a rather pissed Brownie, he supposes this is not the case.

The fact that his head is splintering in half highlights matters.

Still, the monster slides upright. The Brownie wastes no time, eyes wide with a very particular sort of fury, and he reaches for the ruined jacket from that evening, little more than seventeen shreds of brown polyester and peeling threads against his blackened claws.

“I reckon you’re right,” he grumbles out, a drawl in the syllables despite himself, “and I assure you that I am not usually a creature that does not stumble in uninvited.” The embers glow pointedly and the Brownie grows still. “Emergency measures, I assure. But to answer your query….”

He roots through what little is left of his jacket, hoping there’s an answer that the potholes of his mind haven’t swallowed. All that comes up, brittle and strange, is a funny yellow book proclaiming to be an “almanack.”

Cracking the flimsy little cover open, his embers squint as he parrots out, “... I’m Silas Montgomery.” A pause, as he looks up to his hostess, stymied. 

“I think?”</div></lj-cut></center>
